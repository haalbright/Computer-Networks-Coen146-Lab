Observations: In step 3, a segmentation fault occurs because no input it given when executing the code in the terminal. For step 4a, the inputs of 500 and 5000 show that there is no way to predict which thread the scheduler is going to call at any given time.

Output for step 3:
[halbrigh@linux10619 coen146]$ gcc lab1-1.c -o lab1q1
[halbrigh@linux10619 coen146]$ ./lab1q1
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Outputs for step 4:

[halbrigh@linux10619 coen146]$ ./lab1q1 3000
